# Audio Video Sync Dock plugin for OBS Studio

## Introduction

This is an OBS Studio plugin to measure latency between audio and video.

## How to use

### AV offset clip workflow

Use this workflow when you want to measure the relative offset between audio and
video after playing a test clip through an external device and recording it back
with a camera and microphone.

1. Generate a low-flash AV offset clip:

   ```sh
   (cd tool && ./avoffsetgen.py --vr 30 --ar 48000 -o /tmp/av-offset-pattern.mp4)
   ```

   Or use one of the generated MOV files:

   | MOV file | Video frame rate | Supported display frame rate |
   | -------- | ----------------:| ---------------------------- |
   | [av-offset-pattern-6000.mov](https://matiaspl.github.io/obs-audio-video-sync-dock/av-offset-pattern-6000.mov) | 60 FPS | 30 FPS, 60 FPS, or 120 FPS (iPhone) |
   | [av-offset-pattern-5994.mov](https://matiaspl.github.io/obs-audio-video-sync-dock/av-offset-pattern-5994.mov) | 59.94 FPS | 29.97 FPS, 59.94 FPS, or 119.88 FPS |
   | [av-offset-pattern-5000.mov](https://matiaspl.github.io/obs-audio-video-sync-dock/av-offset-pattern-5000.mov) | 50 FPS | 25 FPS or 50 FPS (PAL) |
   | [av-offset-pattern-3000.mov](https://matiaspl.github.io/obs-audio-video-sync-dock/av-offset-pattern-3000.mov) | 30 FPS | 30 FPS or 60 FPS |
   | [av-offset-pattern-2997.mov](https://matiaspl.github.io/obs-audio-video-sync-dock/av-offset-pattern-2997.mov) | 29.97 FPS | 29.97 FPS or 59.94 FPS |
   | [av-offset-pattern-2400.mov](https://matiaspl.github.io/obs-audio-video-sync-dock/av-offset-pattern-2400.mov) | 24 FPS | 24 FPS or 48 FPS |
   | [av-offset-pattern-2398.mov](https://matiaspl.github.io/obs-audio-video-sync-dock/av-offset-pattern-2398.mov) | 23.98 FPS | 23.98 FPS (24 FPS NTSC) |

   The generated MOV files use PCM s16 mono audio and inter-frame H.264 video
   without B-frames.

2. Play the generated clip on the device under test.
3. Capture the device with the camera and microphone that OBS will use.
4. Open the Audio Video Sync dock, select `AV Offset Clip`, and start measuring.

The v2 clip uses sparse checkerboard events for video timing and far-field
acoustic packets for audio timing and identity. The exact audio event is the
center of the packet's short tick inside the centered matched-filter marker.
DTMF uses the standard 4x3 keypad frequencies, an 8-bit event code, CRC8, and
60 ms symbol guards for identity. The measurement is relative AV offset only;
it does not claim true source-to-capture transmission latency.

To verify the reference file itself without OBS media-source scheduling in the
path, run:

```sh
(cd tool && ./verify_avoffset_file.py ../release/av-offset-pattern-media-source.mov)
```

When validating OBS behavior, compare the dock result against an actual OBS
recording made with the same source sync offsets, encoder, frame rate, and audio
buffering settings.

### Legacy workflow

1. Play the video.
   Choose the appropriate video file for your player and OBS Studio configuration.

   | Video file | Video frame rate | Supported display frame rate |
   | ---------- | ----------------:| --------------------- |
   | [sync-pattern-6000.mp4](https://matiaspl.github.io/obs-audio-video-sync-dock/sync-pattern-6000.mp4) | 60 FPS    | 30 FPS, 60 FPS, or 120 FPS (iPhone) |
   | [sync-pattern-5994.mp4](https://matiaspl.github.io/obs-audio-video-sync-dock/sync-pattern-5994.mp4) | 59.94 FPS | 29.97 FPS, 59.94 FPS, or 119.88 FPS |
   | [sync-pattern-5000.mp4](https://matiaspl.github.io/obs-audio-video-sync-dock/sync-pattern-5000.mp4) | 50 FPS    | 25 FPS or 50 FPS (PAL) |
   | [sync-pattern-2400.mp4](https://matiaspl.github.io/obs-audio-video-sync-dock/sync-pattern-2400.mp4) | 24 FPS    | 24 FPS or 48 FPS |
   | [sync-pattern-2398.mp4](https://matiaspl.github.io/obs-audio-video-sync-dock/sync-pattern-2398.mp4) | 23.98 FPS | 23.98 FPS (24 FPS NTSC) |

   - Choose the video frame rate that is same as player's frame rate or twice of that. For example, if your player (or display) is 60 FPS or 30 FPS such as iPhone, choose 60 FPS. If your player is 59.94 FPS or 29.97 FPS, choose 59.94 FPS.
   - If there are multiple candidates, try to choose the same frame rate as OBS Studio or twice of that.

2. Use your camera to shoot the display playing the video so that the pattern appears on the program of OBS Studio.
3. Open the Audio Video Sync dock and start measuring.
4. Check the latency and adjust it accordingly:
   - Positive latency indicates audio is lagged, video is early.
   - Negative latency indicates audio is early, video is lagged.
   - To adjust the audio latency, increase or decrease the Sync Offset in the Advanced Audio Properties dialog in OBS Studio.
   - To adjust the video latency, you have two options:
     - Add a "Video Delay (Async)" filter to Audio/Video Filters on your video source (recommended if your audio comes from a different device).
     - Add a "Render Delay" filter to Effect Filters on your video source (not recommended).
